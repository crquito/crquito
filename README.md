## 🌟 About Me  
Hello! I’m Carlos Quito, a CS Master’s student at NEIU with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and an Associate’s in Computer Information Systems from Wilbur Wright College.  

I’ve built projects in *web and mobile app development, database design, and machine learning**, and gained hands-on experience in robotics programming through NEIU’s STEM Summer Program. I also enjoy tutoring students in programming and problem-solving.  

I'm eager to apply my skills in IT management, software engineering, or business, while I while contributing to innovative projects, and continuing to grow as a professional.
